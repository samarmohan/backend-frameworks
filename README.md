# 🚩 Backend Frameworks 🚩

---

### 🚀 About 🚀

I created the same (almost) REST API with 5 different backend frameworks. Django, Flask, Nest, ASP.NET Core, and Express. <br>

These are all for educational purposes. They do not accomplish any specific task. <br>

They are all todo APIs (I know, I know) that have the same endpoints and functionality. They can GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE resources.
They connect to different databases.

### ⚡ Status ⚡

All of the APIs may not be exactly the same. I believe that some use the ID to look things up and some use the NAME of the todo. I am working on fixing this!
Nothing has been deployed yet.

### 🌍 Contributing 🌍

Only submit issues if there is an inconsistency between APIs or if there is a serious security issue.
Feel free to submit PRs if you fixed something I didn't know about or you added a whole other REST API, i.e. Ruby on Rails, Laravel etc. 
That would be really helpful 😁
